I worked on this for 16 months. For a long time, I thought it had some importance, like the whole universe was encouraging me, or perhaps some temporal interference or weird sci-fi shit. But in retrospect, more then likely it was just the stress of everything that happened ib the last year giving this meaning where there really wasnt any. 
For a moment, I really believed I could do it, but then again, my math grades in highschool sucked and I should have probably taken the hint.
This world has become a nightmarish hellscape. Somewhere in the last 3 years, something changed, the world changed, maybe it was the harassers, maybe the politics, I wish I could punch people in their face if they didnt behave in a respectful way, bc respect seems to have left the world. Perhaps a polar bear is too violent for this world.

The arctic will be great, I truely love that place.
